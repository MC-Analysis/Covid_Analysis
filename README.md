# Covid Analysis


Hello!  

This project is an exploratory analysis and visualization of the Coronavirus Deaths dataset from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
I completed it using MS SQL Server and Tableau Public. I may come back to this dataset in the future because there are so many interesting things to find in this terrible disease that changed the way we live and work.  

Thank you for taking the time to check out this analysis!
